# Nonparametric-Collaborative-Filtering
This code follows directly from the algorithm presented in Blind Regression: Nonparametric Regression for Latent Variable Models via Collaborative Filtering, by researchers at MIT. 

We review the algorithm presented in the paper, and give a high-level overview of the content. We then build the algorithm in R, and test the resulting code with a small example.
